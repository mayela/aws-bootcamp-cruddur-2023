### Credentials configuration

I was able to use and configure my Gitpod environment.

In order to prove that I'm able to use and configure I did the following:

- I created credentials for my user
- I opened my workspace and executed the next commands:
  * ```gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1```
  * ```gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=value```
  * ```gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=value```

I attach evidence of the successful configuration of my credentials:
